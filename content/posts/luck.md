Successful people often attribute their success to their hard work, determination, ambition, and a host of other ego-centric biases.

Now, I'm not diminishing anyone's hard work, determination, or whatever else they may have done. But I want to emphasize that people often overlook the support they've received from others and the good fortune they've had throughout their lives, starting from birth.

It frustrates me when celebrities say that all it takes is "hard work, determination, waking up at 5am, etc." because it ignores the countless individuals who have worked tirelessly without having a lucky break to be successful.

Here's a good video that discusses this topic in depth:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I,
and another light-hearted video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-JgG0ECp2U

With this in mind, I want to remain humble and possibly inspire a few other readers to do the same. I am creating a list of the reasons why I am lucky.

Why am I lucky?
---
* I was born in a prosperous country with relative economic and political stability.
* I live in a country with a good, free healthcare system (at the point of use).
* I was born into a family that, while not wealthy, had the means to support me. I never lacked food, clothing, or educational materials.
* My parents supported my education, even if it was in a sometimes questionable manner.
* I have intelligent and supportive siblings.
* I have no severe health issues.
* I have intelligent and supportive friends from high school. Many people end up in the wrong crowd or lose touch with their high school friends.
* I work in a highly paid field. There are many hardworking people, such as nurses and teachers, who work longer hours and earn less pay.


I will continue to update this list with every roll of the dice that is life.
