Hi, my name is Karan (like 'current' without the 't').

I am a software engineer, powerbuilder, and apparently now a blogger. I intend to 
use this space to document interesting or useful things that I come across. From coding 
and fitness, to photos I take. I'm doing this in the hope that it becomes a great big 
archive of all the things I find myself doing in life, and maybe even helps someone 
along the way.

Hopefully I retain some readers!
